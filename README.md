The Golden7 Final EA is a powerful and highly customizable trading robot for MetaTrader 5. It is designed to identify high-probability trading opportunities by scoring the confluence of multiple technical indicators, which are then qualified by a robust set of filters.

This EA is built to be a flexible trading tool. It can operate as a fully automated trading system or as a powerful assistant, providing signals and managing manual trades with its advanced trade management features. The system combines the logic of its technical scoring engine with the survival instinct of its filters and stop-loss features, giving you the confidence to act on high-conviction signals.

Key Features üìà

    Advanced Confluence Engine: Scores potential trades using a weighted system of 7 technical indicators (MA, ADX, Bollinger Bands¬Æ, RVI, SAR, RSI) and a user-defined fundamental bias.

    Multi-Trade Logic: Capable of managing multiple independent positions (max 1 buy and 1 sell), with a master control to set the maximum number of total open trades.

    Manual Fundamental Bias: Integrate your own market analysis by setting a fundamental score from +8 (strongly bullish) to -8 (strongly bearish), which directly influences the EA's decisions.

    Manual Trade Assistant: An optional mode to allow the EA's advanced Breakeven Plus and Trailing Stop logic to manage trades that you have opened manually.

    Full Alert System: Never miss a signal with pop-up, mobile push, and email notifications for high-scoring trade setups.
